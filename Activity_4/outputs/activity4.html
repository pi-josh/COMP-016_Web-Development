            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The total cost is calculated by multiplying the price of each item by the number of items purchased. In this case, 50 * 3 = 150.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This demonstrates how a score can be adjusted by adding bonus points and subtracting penalty points. Here, 85 + 15 - 5 = 95.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The score is calculated by starting with a base score of 800, then applying bonuses and penalties for each of the 7 levels. For each level, the player earns a bonus of 150 points but also loses 30 points as a penalty. If the final score exceeds the threshold of 1200, an additional bonus of 100 points is added. In this case, the final score is calculated as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Base Score = 800</li>
                <li>Level Bonus = 150, Level Penalty = 30</li>
                <li>Levels = 7</li>
                <li>Bonus and Penalty for all levels = (150 - 30) * 7 = 120 * 7 = 840</li>
                <li>Final Score before bonus = 800 + 840 = 1640</li>
                <li>Since the final score is greater than 1200, bonus points of 100 are added.</li>
                <li>Final Score = 1640 + 100 = ${finalScoreGame}</li>
